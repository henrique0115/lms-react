          <p>
            'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love <br>
            Not knowing what it was <br>
            I will not give you up this time <br>
            But darling, just kiss me slow <br>
            Your heart is all I own <br>
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine

          <p>
            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark <br>
            With you between my arms <br>
            Barefoot on the grass <br>
            Listening to our favourite song <br>
            When you said you looked a mess <br>
            I whispered underneath my breath <br>
            But you heard it <br>
            Darling, you look perfect tonight

            Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know <br>
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home <br>
            I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets <br>
            To carry love, to carry children of our own

            We are still kids, but we're so in love <br>
            Fighting against all odds <br>
            I know we'll be alright this time <br>
            Darling, just hold my hand <br>
            Be my girl, I'll be your man <br>
            I see my future in your eyes

            Barefoot on the grass <br>
            Listening to our favorite song <br>
            When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful <br>
            I don't deserve this <br>

            With you between my arms <br>
            Barefoot on the grass <br>
            Listening to our favorite song <br>
            I have faith in what I see <br>
            Now I know I have met an angel in person <br>
            And she looks perfect <br>
