                    I will not give you up this time <br>
                    But darling, just kiss me slow <br>
                    Your heart is all I own <br>

                    Barefoot on the grass <br>
                    Listening to our favourite song <br>
                    When you said you looked a mess <br>
                    I whispered underneath my breath <br>
                    But you heard it <br>
